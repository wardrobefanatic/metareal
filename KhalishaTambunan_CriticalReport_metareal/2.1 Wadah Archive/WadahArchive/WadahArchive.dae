How can we use 3D and digital methodologies and materials to reconstruct the symbolic meaning, value, and histories of forgotten objects from mass culture? 

┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☝︎━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┙



For my first self-directed project, Laiqa and I utilised a collection of so-called forgotten objects collected from a warehouse in Jogjakarta, Indonesia, as material. The warehouse acts as a container that holds objects that people no longer want to own but not throwing them straight in the bin, so the objects carried an assumption of value. The pursuit of collecting these objects in itself would not have happened if we did not reach out to our tour guide and driver, Pak Hotman, about our interest in collecting objects. Had he not leveraged his connections, we would never have received access to these objects. Upon encountering these objects, as an Indonesian, I knew that these once-mass-produced objects had plenty of sentimental value to people who were born in a particular era. For example, a peppermint bottle that was smaller than a finger which only Dutch-Chinese-Indonesian company could have produced under colonial rule. Such objects obtain a specific value because they can capture a point in time as it has reached it's obsolescence. These objects carry a particular life; even though intangible, they still roam through text and collective memory through people. And so, how can we gather these individuals who do have memories about these objects, and how can we bring others who don't necessarily do?

I follow an Indonesian Facebook community called "Nostalgia 80 dan 90an." Even though I wasn't born in that era and experienced the things that the people in the community had, I enjoy getting to know the past and the memories that may only be revealed in the small nooks and crannies of the comment sections of each post. By reading posts about objects, moments, and memories about the past with whom I share the same culture, in some way, I get to know myself more. With each upload of a nostalgic relic, a cascading feedback loop of conversations occur. I find these comments valuable and somewhat raw and unkempt. You can say that these Facebook communities become containers of relics of obsolete everyday paraphernalia, a public, open-source, living archive - or a time capsule.
Speaking to Laiqa and her family, I discovered that in India, people often navigate spaces not with streets and roads but with shops, directions, and landmarks in spoken instructional language. Roads often do not have memorable names, and as a result, these 'landmarks' hold value and importance due to the subjective value given to it by people who use them to navigate a space. As a result, a place gains permanence, tangibility. A tiny food shop now gains momentum and brings in crowds due to this navigational importance. City infrastructures are susceptible to closing down due to the pace of change in the city. However, a dynamic and interchangeable space now becomes static and permanent. Collective experiences give such value to a place. Because of its landmarks and visible characteristics, a place can become a landmark, thus becoming a navigational tool.
From this brief, I re-interpreted it as an opportunity to seek the same inquiry towards my practice as a graphic designer, particularly a designer who works in the digital space. While acknowledging the digital dominance of our current epoch, how can we aspire to produce and construct digital spaces/experiences that directly communicate to the senses? And with the limitations of physical interaction, how can we maintain a sense of tangibility and collective memory?
 
On behalf of museums - who gets to assign meaning towards objects, and are these processes wholly institutionalised? When we go to museums, where do the conversations we have about displayed objects go apart from fizzling into the air? How do we introduce ourselves to the object and vice versa? In terms of these objects, Laiqa and I do not know much about the objects themselves. Even though there are traces of recognisable elements, is it our place to assign it meaning? Isn't it about subjective and speculative narratives? What if we propose a different way of experiencing an archive beyond just objective/concrete data points? What constitute a "living archive"

Encountering "Vernacular" Objects from the lens of the Museum

┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☝︎━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┙


"It is important to remember that we - I who write this paper and you who find yourself reading it - are actors in the story. It is our better understanding, as we live our lives, of the process of making meaning which enables us to analyse the nature of our relation to the objects which come from the past, and to perceive how they affect us." - (Susan Pearce,, 1990: 40)
 
As conveyed through Hofer's imagery of museums and their inner workings, it is almost transparent that there is a discernment between the museum/audience relationship. Her photographs offer a one-directional dialogue between the objects. Two photographs that drew me the most were a photograph of two individuals wearing a full-coverage PPE suit while analysing some objects on a table. This image conveys total distance and a sense of foreignness, even though such an object may not be so alien as it seems to be. Would we engage with these artifacts in such a manner in the ordinary sense? It questions the uncanny situation - who is being investigated? The person in the suit, or the object itself? (Franke, 2018)

In Museums and the Interpretation of Visual Culture, Eilean Hooper-Greenhill discusses the structure of museum pedagogy and its' implications. Museums are often described as a "pedagogic tool;" based on "formal didacticism and on the conviction that placing objects on view "was essential to ensure learning." The issue with the museological framework is that objects are often "positioned, ordered, cataloged, categorised, protected, and preserved, existence is assured and value perpetuated by curatorial policy" (Clark, 2012). Experiencing an object, whether in a warehouse or a museum, is a multisensory experience and can be challenging to articulate. Since the museum is a public space, objects are open to interpretation. Concerning the objects collected from Jogjakarta, I came across similar questions. 
 Alexandra Bounia investigates the collection of Eleni Stathatos and the donation of the display to several museums. These objects have interacted daily as a feature of a domestic environment. The unique collection has been constructed as a reflection of self and engagement with the past through contemporary life. A historical and sociological perspective reflects upon the individuality, personal understanding, and interpretation, which influenced the process and rationale of the collection (Bounia, 2012). Watch Archive's display collection of vernacular objects function in a similar way to Stathatos' display. Focusing on conscious subjectivity, we want to invite a collective assignment of meaning. Her collection constructs a reflection of self and the past through contemporary life. Akin to Stathatos, we position ourselves as custodians of these objects and invite narratives that would endure along with it. "Collections are essentially a narrative of experience; as objects are a kind of material language" (Pearce, 1995).

We utilise alternative display methods via the digital interface to challenge museum conventions. Alexandra Brysbaert proposes that a new methodological framework is needed so that discourse can be presented in an alternative and more holistic way to visitors, and encourage deeper engagement through more nuanced and varied interpretations. (Brysbaert, Binnie, 2012) Brysbaert also proposes that this framework will foster more significant interaction from many visitors (Brysbaert, Binnie, 2012). To acknowledge the complex narratives that may emerge from speculation, we encourage considering Saidiya Hartman's theory of critical fabulation.

On Digital Surrogates of "Vernacular" Objects and Their Value

┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☝︎━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┙


Axiology describes as the act of classifying what is good or how valuable something is. The experience of mortality may significantly impact the human understanding of values (Wojewoda, 2018). Wojewoda states the awareness of existence is associated with the awareness of the loss of goods that we possess in our lives. Such a loss or the finitude of things insists us of their significance. Digital objects are crystallized in voxels, unable to decay thanks to its' material lack. If so, does that mean that this transference into the digital removes its' imposed value? 
 
Since human hands touch objects before entering the digital universe, how may we mediate that transition? How can we decide what has value when human experiences are premeditated or simulated in the digital or networked space? Does this lack of tangibility affect our conscious experiences and our perspectives?
 
Nicole Meehan extensively discusses the implications of materiality and notions of value through digital museum objects, which I will frequently quote in the following few paragraphs. Our objective with the archive was to share it with the world through the Internet. It is impossible to magically upload a "hard" object into a digital, non-tactile space like the Internet; thus, photogrammetry became the method to transfer these objects into the virtual space. In the act of such a transference of these "hard" objects into "soft" objects, we must consider the three following qualities; materiality, aura, and value (Meehan, 2020). 
 
Materiality (or something regarded as tactile in this regard) posits two characteristics that define the value of physical, which is lacking in a digital object (Meehan, 2020). Engagement with digital museum objects may be able to shape cultural memory in divergent ways. Digital object's insertion into, and circulation within, a broader economy of cultural and commercial exchange also can break down the traditional 'aura' of museum objects and cultural artifacts. This interaction enhances the potential to normalise artistic interpretations, activating other voices not generally or well-articulated by established cultural institutions. (Meehan, 2020). The digital object can act as a text document, image, sound audio or audiovisual recording, and diverse forms. Digital surrogates, complement, surrogate, and copy are similar words used in museum terminology that carry subtle yet distinct meanings, often relating to ideas of value and materiality. 
Surrogate = means to act as a substitute
Complement = ancillary entity used to increase the value oft he core ;thing; 
Copy = reproduction, facsimile, aura-less
If we cannot physically touch an object, is it necessarily immaterial? Views upon the materiality of the digital object play a significant role in designations of value (Meehan, 2020). If the digital continues to be positioned relative to, and thus inevitably, in a lower position, the physical will continue to be of lesser value. 
 
Meehan argues that we may not truly appreciate what the digital museum object as separate from the physical object. Failing to consider the digital in its own right, struggled to comprehend its impact upon cultural economies, "specifically audience engagement, knowledge acquisition, and memory production. "(Meehan, 2020). From conducted interviews and surveys show the success of facilitating the formation of connections by diverse audiences, quotes from one interviewee "these links can be speculative, encouraging non‐traditional interpretation, or allowing for the presentation of relationships that wouldn't be physically possible" (Meehan, 2020).
 
A "harnessed" ambiguity is arguably poetry and myth. As Bachelard mentions in Poetics of Space, a great verse can have a significant influence on the soul of a language. It awakens images, at the same time that it confirms the unforeseeable nature of speech. Perhaps there is the existing potential of changing objects entirely from their original state through photogrammetry, and through this method, there is beauty in the different ways of transference. Looking at a nostalgic object up close and personally creates brand new viewing experiences and a sense of magic, which opens up conversations. Wadah Archive embraces ambiguity in a similar fashion to how poetry has the potential to create value out of ambiguity. Users are encouraged to fabulate as well as comment on the object and discuss what tbe object could be, from the starting points that Laiqa and I, as the beholder of these objects, have given hints from our own (admitted) perspectives. We are hoping to create a domino effect and entangling of various perspectives to give life to these objects.

Hypertext, semantics and spatial interfaces

┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☝︎━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┙


"The imagination separates us from the past as well as from reality - it faces the future. if we cannot imagine, we cannot foresee." 
Bachelard, Poetics of Space


In the act of assigning narratives, we start with writing. Saidiya Hartman's Venus in Two Acts talks about critical fabulation as a method to tell stories that acknowledge the complexity of a character in a story, instead of assigning a character as a protagonist nor an antagonist. According to Ursula K. Guin's Carrier Bag of Fiction, history is written by the victors. Stories from individuals, rather than levels of conquest. In history, we keep using the spear as a metaphor to tell grandeur stories about humanity, but we haven't always considered placing the other tool, which is the basket. Tools of exerting energy, for example, the axe had a difference between tools that are meant to bring energy home, for example, a basket. Le Guin argues that the empty vessel came before the spear. The carrier bag enabled early humans to hold more than they could. Considering the importance of the carrier bag, we shift the way we view human history from a "narrative of domination to one that's more focused on gathering, holding and sharing" (Leddy, 2019). We can argue that the act of gathering was an essential element of humanity. What arguably makes an object memorable or retain value was its potential to become a container that carries a narrative threshold. As a response, we named our online platform Wadah Archive, wadah being the Indonesian term for container - literally and metaphorically.
 
Our interface is directly inspired by our prior experiments on psychogeography and speculative narratives; Wadah Archive's design is constructed around the idea of spatial thinking. 3D objects are hosted on the site, enabling the user to zoom, drag, and rotate the things around. Spatial software comes with more degrees of freedom, whether to move and drag a 3D object on the screen to see the finer details that 2D images won't. We wanted the contributions towards the object to be anonymous, so it appears as a stream of consciousness in space, as if it came from one voice that speaks to itself, contributing in unity. What is generated from this designed effect is a piece of hypertext. Mindy Seu discussed the notion of possibly cataloging/organising the objects in a non-hierarchal taxonomy (not top-bottom, but like a web). To achieve this, we designed the object index to be in a nonlinear fashion and added an aspect of randomness to add an element of chance and surprise. We want audiences to experience a state of curiosity, almost a blank-slate - to enact the same psychogeographical walk around the object and throughout the index itself. By removing identity in the form of names, we position voices to be on a level plane.
 
Hypertext is described as "a specific form of digital fiction in which fragments of electronic text, known as lexis, are connected by hyperlinks." (van Dijk, 2011) Hypertext literature is a nonlinear form of digital text that allows a reader to choose their own pathway among multiple interconnected elements. According to an article on Rhizome, for example, trans people have embraced the genre, using it to challenge traditional narratives, model alternate social realities, and build empathy and as a form of personal expression. Hypertext systems may combine the roles of designer and learner by creating a collaborative environment in which the learner can annotate, amend, or author both content and structural elements of the hypertext." (Jonassen, 1991). Coined by Ted Nelson in the 1960s, hypertext is referred, in the generic sense, to nonlinear structured documents and information knowledge bases constructed from various sources of mediums, known as hypermedia. Hypermedia is understood as the nonlinear structure of information systems that include graphics, audio, video, plain text, and hypertexts alike. It allows the user to click images, graphics, and other media apart from text to create a nonlinear network of information.
 
What's unique about such nonlinear systems, that it differs from automated computer systems. Hypertext is not typically designed by a particular instructional model - instead, hypertext is "frequently said to mimic the properties of the mind" (Fiderio, 1988). The blocks of most hypermedia systems are nodes and links. Nodes are fragments of information, whether that be text, graphics, or video, that comprise the basic unit of information. Authors of traditional, linear text typically provide connectives and other cues to make the structure comprehensible. However, such a rigid structure and connection may seem arbitrary to readers. Since every person's knowledge structure is subjective to personal knowledge and experience, the way each reader chooses to interrelate information is also unique. (Jonassen, 1991).
 
In hypertexts, it operates on so-called database logic (Baetens et al., 2013). In such logic, the dominant structure of the text is not sequential, but the possibility of nonlinearity sampling of material borrowed from existing databases - spatial arrangement becomes more critical than temporal ordering (Baetens et al., 2013). Wadah Archive encourages the act of roaming akin to psychogeographical explorations. Forking paths enables divergence, can let audiences experience a story world overall. It is as if the story has already happened - the task assigned to the reader is to decide to go into the variety of parallel universes. Storyworlds suggest underlying structures without fully revealing them at first to make the work more about the journey of uncovering meaning. These underlying structures are collected from users through a designed graphical user interface. Spinning the 3D object and pinning the object enables users to contribute a comment, select a glyph that symbolises conversational semantic meaning. From the combination of text, media and imagery emerge new narratives, speculative narratives open for discussion.
