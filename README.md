This is Khalisha Tambunan’s instructions for metareal - the critical report.

Each object contains a different section of the critical report according to the table of contents, and 3D object’s visual is an overarching motif derived from the content of the text itself. Alongside each folder are a series of images that accompany the text, labeled accordingly.

Rendering the critical report in this way enables a non-linear way of reading. Embedding text into this format is a type of encryption of dissemination. I chose this process as I often worked with Blender (an open-source 3D program) throughout the unit,  aspects of the model, both visually and form-ally. I am conveying the idea of modification and fabrication. The text is embedded within the .XML format. of the 3D object, which is accessible through any text editor, such as VS Code. I recommend using TextEdit on Mac, or Notepad on Windows. 

Instructions (on a Mac);
1. To view the object, press Spacebar, or open via Preview.
2. Click and drag around the 3D object to look around. On a trackpad you can zoom in with 2 fingers.
2. To read the critical report text(s), right-click on the object and select Open with... program of choice (VS Code OR TextEdit)
